1. What is logging?
   Logging is the process of recording information about a program's execution, such as events, errors, and operations, to help monitor and debug the application.

2. Why is logging important?
   Logging is important because it aids in debugging, monitoring application health, auditing activities, and tracking errors, providing insights into the application's behavior and performance.

3. Understanding logging levels:
   - DEBUG: Detailed information, used for diagnosing problems.
   - INFO: General information about application processes.
   - WARN: Indications of potential issues or important events.
   - ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
   - FATAL: Severe error events that lead to application termination.
